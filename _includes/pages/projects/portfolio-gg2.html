The Gentlemenâ€™s Gentlemen is a concept from Brian Getnick and Noe Kidder. These USA-based artist invented a theaterplay about a theater (somewhere near the Erie-cannal) that is home to an actor/boar, an actress, a living potted palm, a talking chandelier (that loves mayonnaise), a God- like evil janitor and a rehearsed audience. There is a world above and a world below. Some terrible horrors happen and the whole story has the feeling of being endless and of repeating itself. In 2008 Getnick and Kidder collaborated with R&amp;F F&amp;R for a Belgian production of the GG in CROXHAPOX Ghent. 9 years later, CROX offered F&amp;R the opportunity to do a remake... This
time, Robbert and Frank combined forces with the girls from Buren collective, building a giant scenography with various small installations depicting bits&amp;pieces of the story.

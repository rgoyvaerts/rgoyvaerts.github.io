Video art. A house with several rooms. Each room containing: a special build deÃÅcor, some personages and a set of strange rules. The camera works in a voyeuristic way, spying on the characters. The collected footage is pixilated and has some enthralling extras: depth measurements, time indication, enhanced zoom, focus-in-screen, etc. We see an edited version of the things that are happening in this house. It feels like a parallel world where there is no beginning and no end. Powergames. All masked characters play powergames.

<p>In this video you can experience a virtual walk through F&amp;R R&amp;F’s solo exhibition ‘Breadcrumbs’. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, it was difficult to visit the venue in person. That’s why the artists wanted to make the exhibition accessible online through video.</p>

<p>Frank&amp;Robbert Robbert&amp;Frank present a retrospective of their past five years' work (2015-2020). Through theatrical dioramas, photo and video works, sculptures, blueprints, screen prints and clay tablets, the artists tell a story that links their everyday reality to philosophical and societal questions. </p>

<p>A major focus in the exhibition is the role of the artist in the public space and the creation of a personal mythology.</p>
    
<p>Their jumping-off point is a series of wooden suitcases that they developed some years back during their summer residency at Be-Part. Like the duo's artistic practice, these constructions straddle the boundary of craftsmanship and performance, sculpture and prop, public and private space, gadget and artwork.</p>
    
<p>They also present a series of recent editions, in each of which a new medium is explored: 3D prints, ceramic tablets and silk-screen prints. In these works the matter of representation is of central importance. For the artists, this is linked to their search for their own ultimate and authentic personal symbology.</p>
    
<p>By repeatedly exposing both themselves and their work to new contexts and environments, the artists attempt to share with spectators the poetic potential of their work.</p>

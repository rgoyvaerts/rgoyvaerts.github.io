<p>With this brick, Frank&amp;Robbert Robbert&amp;Frank fulfil a self-created need. Ever since their travels in Asia, the artists have become fascinated by shrines, house spirits, etc. In short, certain places have a unique energy and human interventions can serve to amplify or dampen this energy. With their ‘brick that improves the world’, Robbert&amp;Frank Frank&amp;Robbert can positively charge the energy of certain buildings with meaning.

<p>Stone is timeless. And highly durable thanks to its material qualities. R&amp;F F&amp;R make their own bricks out of natural clay, which they fire at 1,270 degrees. This makes the bricks stable and watertight. Implanting the brick is an almost surgical act; with the necessary precision they intervene and swap the temporary for the permanent.</p>

<p>The duo implanted the first brick at artist Wim Wauman’s studio in Sint-Niklaas. Wauman’s focus is on form, combining wood veneering with rituals and performance. For his research project ‘Blauwhaus’ he enters into collaborations and/or exchanges with other artists. The placement of this first brick at Wauman’s studio was thus an experimental first.</p>
    
<p>Frank&amp;Robbert Robbert&amp;Frank developed the mantra GO AWAY SORROW OF THE WORLD back in 2008. This mantra works as a shadow whose concept always remains the same but whose physical carrier changes from time to time. The mantra has previously been placed atop a 12-metre poll, incorporated in a ritual, built into a foldable wooden suitcase, made into a pin, etc. (check out these projects <a href="{{site.url}}/sorrow-blog">here</a>) And now, for the first time, it has taken the form of a custom-made brick.</p>

This trophy is made of reclaimed pieces of wood. It is an ode to the persistence and ingenuity of people working in the arts. A lot of them have to make do with minimal means and still create wonderful experiences. Long live the arts!

During the corona crisis we realized that culture in all its forms and formats is an essential part of our social fabric and very important for our mental and physical health. Long live the arts!

In December 2021 the Belgian government decided to shut down all cultural activities. The pubs and restaurants were allowed to stay open meanwhile, as were outdoor Christmas markets, non-essential shops etc. This led to big protests and the cultural sector took the matter to the Council of State. They won the case: the Council of State called the closure "a disproportionate measure" which "lacked an adequate motivation". Long live the arts!

As you can see we share a cookie. Despite what people say, there is enough for everybody. Everybody is entitled to a piece of the pie. Let’s stop thinking in terms of scarcity and start thinking in terms of abundance, sharing the wealth and solidarity. That is our whish for 2022. 
</p>
<p>
Long live the arts and Happy New Year!

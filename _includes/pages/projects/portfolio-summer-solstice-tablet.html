    <p>Robbert&Frank Frank&Robbert are in Erlangen for the German premiere of <a
            href="https://www.table-dialogues.com/wood">WOOD</a>, their latest theatrical creation in
        the <a href="https://www.table-dialogues.com/wood">Table Dialogues</a> series.</p>

    <p>They created a summer solstice stone using a CO2 laser, etching a drawing into its body. The high temperatures of
        the laser melted and crystallized the stone, resulting in a drawing that seems to have become part of the
        stonework, with clear, deep, sparkling lines.
    </p>

    <p>The stone was taken to the beautiful Botanical Garden of Erlangen, connecting the artwork with the awakening
        force of nature in springtime. Form follows content, which follows environment.
    </p>

    <p>The drawing depicts a central figure shouldered by two spiritual beings, symbolizing the ever-lasting duality in
        nature and the cosmos. The central figure transforms while the surrounding nature blooms. The spiritual beings
        search for contact, familiar yet unreal, with hands instead of antlers, like Frank and Robbert, who wore hands
        on top of their heads in their theater show, <a
            href="http://localhost:3000/portfolio/grand-human-projects">‘Don’t we deserve grand human projects that give
            us meaning?’</a>
        (CAMPO 2017). The hands connect the beings with supernatural entities in the sky, linking the earth below with
        the heavens above.
    </p>

    <p>During the summer solstice, the magic energy peaks, symbolizing the transformation evoked by Jupiter, resulting
        in the birth of Fors Fortuna, the Goddess of Luck. It’s a time to test luck and reconnect with one’s true self,
        disconnected from the darkness of the cosmos and revitalized by the energy of the Sun.
    </p>

    <p>In ancient times, the summer solstice was a time of reflection, as farmers observed the harvest potential and the
        vital flow of life in the plants. It’s a time of gratitude for surviving winter and for nature’s bounty. Embrace
        the fertility and renewal of the season, and connect with nature.

‚Crowds’ consists of 4 big panels, presenting a huge photoshopped mass. This mass is a big collage of groups of people found on the internet... Muslims on a square, alien-worshipers, KKK- members cheering, football fans near the stadium,... ‚Crowds’ is (in a way) a naive work: it is a
 forced unification of the human race -. As artists, Robbert&Frank Frank&Robbert want people of all race / gender / color to become ‚one’; peacefully / respectfully / happily. Therefore many hidden jokes are incorporated or hidden amongst the masses. -Where is Waldo?-

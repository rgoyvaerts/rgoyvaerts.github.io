In aftermath of their GUNS installation, R&F F&R received a commission from Gallery Ganache, a Ghent-based luxury chocolate shop, to remake GUNS. The remake had to be a fully fledged artwork of itself so, they took apart 3 wooden guns and transformed them into chocolate building sets, by making molds out of the basic blocks. At first sight, these ‘Do-It-Yourself’ boxes seem to present themselves as industrial-made vendibles, but F&R R&F created their own personalized chocolate, hand-made their own packages and plastics, and by doing so created an exclusive line whereby each and every piece is unique.

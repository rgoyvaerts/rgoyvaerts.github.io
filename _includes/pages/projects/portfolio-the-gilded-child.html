Since 2010 F&R have been filming themselves while traveling the globe, building exhibitions or doing weird things. This collection of footage has resulted in diverse pieces of video art. In the video work THE GILDED CHILD they mix footage of themselves (wondering through Qatari deserts) with the opening titles of the best known Hollywood film production companies (MGM with their lion, Pegasus with their flying horse,...) Spiced with political youtube videos and a re- enactment of Kubricks ‚2001: A Space Odyssey’, this 13 min. long edit is a balanced combination of symbolism and power-play.

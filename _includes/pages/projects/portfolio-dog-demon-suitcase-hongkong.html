<p>This <strong>four-colour silkscreen print</strong> was made by the artists themselves. R&amp;F F&amp;R made seven prints in total, including one artist print. The work documents an <strong>action/performance in the public space</strong>, which took place in Lan Kwai Fong, a square in Hong Kong popular among expats for its nightlife. </p>

<p>F&amp;R R&amp;F constructed a series of wooden suitcases (see also the work: <a href="{{site.url}}/portfolio/dog-demon-suitcase">Dog Demon Suitcase</a>). Each case is in fact a portable performance and/or installation. The works only realise their full potential when installed and activated in the public space. As artists the duo have <strong>a holistic approach</strong>. Coincidence and intuition play a significant role in their work. The temporary nature of their performances or interventions in the public space is an essential aspect of their work. </p>

<p>This silkscreen print documents one such intervention in the public space. While exploring Hong Kong at dusk, suitcases in hand, the artists came upon a number of damaged and messily packaged <strong>Buddha statuettes</strong>, completely out of context. The poor weather and graffitied security shutters added to the somewhat forlorn yet <strong>magical sense of place</strong>. Intuitively they decided to place their own sculpture among the statues. Although it may appear contradictory, even lightly blasphemous, the sight does perfectly reflect the <strong>energy of Hong Kong</strong>, where centuries-old culture and philosophy meet contemporary culture. </p>
    
<p>This silkscreen print makes tangible F&amp;R R&amp;F’s quest to <strong>build bridges between cultures</strong>, here placing their figurine literally alongside the Buddhas in an attempt to show their perspective on the rapidly-evolving reality that surrounds them and all of us. This duality – between East and West, Asia and Europe, old and new cultures and the associated visual languages and layers of meaning – is coming to be a common thread in the work of F&amp;R R&amp;F. Ultimately the same questions keep arising over and over again: who are we? Where do we come from? And, most of all, where are we headed?</p>
    
<p>By documenting this moment, carrying it with them, and later turning it into this large-format silkscreen print, R&amp;F F&amp;R give <strong>a new interpretation to their past performance</strong>. It brings to mind the the law of conservation of energy, which states that energy can neither be lost, nor can it arise from nothing; it can only be transformed. </p>

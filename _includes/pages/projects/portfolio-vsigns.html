The V stands for ‚Victory’, but also for ‚Fuck You’. In old days it was a spiritual protection to wear off demons and ghosts. V symbolizes sexuality but it’s also used as a FreeMason rank. Almost like Marchel Duchamps ‚Moules’, it can be seen as an ‚empty vessel’, representing hundreds of possible connotations. Every single tourist does the V sign, all politicians and movie stars... R&amp;F F&amp;R have made cardboard figures of these well known media figures while ‚doing’ the V sign. Playing with the size and placement, Frank and Robbert have made an ‚army’ of figures doing ‚bunny-ears’ / ‚donkey-ears’ with the figure in front of them. Everyone is mocking everyone (in a symbolic appropriate way).

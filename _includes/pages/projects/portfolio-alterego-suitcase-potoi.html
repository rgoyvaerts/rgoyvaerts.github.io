<p>This large-format, four-colour silkscreen print depicts the <a href="{{site.url}}/portfolio/alterego-suitcase">‘Alter-Ego Suitcase’</a> set up on the bay of Po Toi island, Hong Kong. A limited edition of seven silkscreen prints was produced by the artists themselves in their atelier.</p>

<p>The wooden suitcase, purposefully made at the scale of carry-on hand luggage suitable for transport on planes and trains, serves as a portable artwork. This small, unfoldable home altar is devoted to the mythical anthropomorphic animal figures Reindeer and Bull. These are the alter egos of Robbert and Frank, respectively.</p>

<p>By activating this suitcase in striking locations, such as here on Po Toi Island, Frank&amp;Robbert create a temporary artwork each time it is deployed. On and around the suitcase we can see a number of lucky finds from the island presented as votive offerings for the altar. By embracing coincidence, Robbert&amp;Frank allow the location to leave its mark on the work. More than simply an aesthetic object, this print also documents a ritual, performative act, an adventure and a journey.</p>
    
<p>Silkscreen printing is a technique used to build up an image in patterned layers, typically comprising the colours cyan, magenta, yellow and black. The separate printing of each layer – leading to slight variations in alignment with each new print – gives rise to a unique result each time. This reflects how each ‘deployment’ of the suitcase in a new location is likewise identical yet unique.</p>

<p>The infinitely complex interplay of time and space, circumstances and people, objects and animals, forms a fantastic basis for the creation of beauty and wonder. Frank&amp;Robbert celebrate this by bringing their work into the outside world.</p>

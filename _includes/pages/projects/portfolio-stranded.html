<p>If you ever find yourself utterly lost in the Arctic, you might notice something glinting in the sun on a rock by a frozen lake. On closer inspection, you might discover, screwed down tight to the rock, a small aluminium palm tree and a matching figure with hands held aloft. If you look even closer, you may discover that the screws are personalised Frank&amp;Robbert screws. This work, titled Stranded, is itself stranded here. No geolocation tags, no plaque, no path and no signposts. </p>

<p>The artists purposefully left this installation in ‘the middle of nowhere’ as a gift to the world, a detail for whomever might notice the tiny intervention. To the potential finder it presents itself as an anomaly, a glitch, an error. </p>

<p>Stranded proposes a striking metaphor for the human condition. We are stranded on our lonely planet that encircles the Sun, somewhere in a relatively minor spiral arm of the Milky Way galaxy. While this may be a daunting notion, the idea can also be empowering: we are alone together, after all.</p> 

<p>As is often the case in the work of Robbert&amp;Frank, the work is not without a touch of dry humour. With the climate crisis threatening to devastate ecosystems and change the face of our planet forever, Frank&amp;Robbert bring the the first palm tree to the Arctic.</p> 

<p>However, the ambiguity of the figure’s pose may betray a more hopeful attitude toward the future. Is the figure surrendering? Begging for a deus ex machina? Or do the outstretched arms signal a readiness to accept responsibility and take action?

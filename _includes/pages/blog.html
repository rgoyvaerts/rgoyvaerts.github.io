    <strong>In this blog you can follow <a href="../about/">Robbert&amp;Frank Frank&amp;Robbert</a> as they travel around the globe 🌍 to spread their message 'GO AWAY SORROW OF THE WORLD'.</strong><br/><br/> 
    
    During December 2020 ❄️🎄🎁, the message will travel around in Bern (CH) as an advertisement banner on the tram. <a href="https://auawirleben.ch/de" target="_blank">Theaterfestival Auawirleben</a> invited the visual artists to adapt their project and occupy this commercial space with an artwork.<br><br>
    
    Just like monks that repetitively chant the same phrase over and over again, R&amp;F F&amp;R are repeating ⏳ the action of presenting the exact same message of peace in different places, languages and contexts. Whenever someone reads the message, or even thinks the message, a vibration 💫 is send into the universe. <br><br>
        
    In an absurdist but sincere attempt to create change through art, F&amp;R R&amp;F deploy various strategies to present the message in public space. ⛳<br><br>
    
    The ultimate goal being that all these little vibrations will start to resonate and create a powerful call to action 📢. A positive call to make a difference, in whatever futile way you can think of. In the end it is not so important  <strong>what </strong> you do exactly, but  <strong>how </strong> you do it 🦄.<br><br>

            <strong>Go Away Sorrow Of The World – The Movie 🎥 </strong>

        With a little wooden suitcase as their only weapon Frank&amp;Robbert Robbert&amp;Frank try to make the world a better place. Each time they present their suitcase the message is translated in the local language.<br><br> 

        On every spot F&amp;R R&amp;F film the installation / inauguration of the suitcase and print a postcard of the action (with a little portable printer). The marked and stamped postcards are the certificate and proof of the action. Scroll down this page to see the postcard collection.<br><br>

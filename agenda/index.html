<p><strong>Zalando-man, Gentse Feesten</strong><br />
Frank&mp;Robbert Robbert&amp;Frank were asked by <a href="https://cirq.be">Cirq</a> to have a digital social experiment at 'DataCamp' — this years Cirq festival @ The Gentse Feesten.

<p><strong>Dark Matter Games (Venice biënnale off program)</strong>    <br />
Dark Matter is a concept borrowed from astronomy: its the invisible subatomic matter that constitutes all reality. New York based theoretician Gregory Sholette borrowed this term to designate a counter- hegemonic device in the art feld. Although experimental and hybrid artistic production rooted in social processes is essential to the art world in general, it stays highly invisible in the current system due to its object- and market oriented drive: it is a dark matter.

<p><strong>THE PURSUIT OF THE GENTLEMEN'S GENTLEMEN</strong><br />
The great renewal of Croxhapox's first 'The Gentlemens Gentlemen' edition (2008 - original concept by <a href="http://briangetnick.com" target="_blank">Brian Getnick</a>  &amp; <a href="http://noekidder.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Noe Kidder</a>). Instead of creating a new performance, this collaboration between <a href="http://www.oshinalbrecht.be/index.php?page=buren" target="blank">De Buren collective</a> (Oshin Albrecht and Melissa Mabesoone) and R&F F&R will be based on the creation of 16 'play board' game tiles.

<p><strong>MADE IN BRUSSELS - POP UP SHOP FOR THE ARTS</strong><br />
Les Plaisirs d'Hivers, Workspace Brussels, Brussels Major Events (BME) and Beursschouwbeurs have selected 40 artists. The idea is to make an exhibition of affordable Brussels based or linked art. And to give an overview of the wealth of the creative Belgian scene. The exhibition will also function as a pop/up gallery, meaning that all works are also for sale (5/500EUR).
The project will be an autonomous project, linked to Plaisirs d'Hivers, the Brussels Christmas market with over 1 million visitors. It will be a creative alternative for the more commercial activities in that time of the year.<br />

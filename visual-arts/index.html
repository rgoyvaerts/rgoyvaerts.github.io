More light-hearted and gleeful, than the themes explored might suggest, F&R R&F’s <strong>films, performances, installations and objects</strong> burgeon a universe of their own. In this world, shaped by idiosyncratic logics, rules and structures, it might not always be apparent, which is ping, or what is pong, but perhaps ideas, thoughts and concepts become more compelling when they stop making sense, when the thrill of the game wins over the conditions of our present day.<br><br>
